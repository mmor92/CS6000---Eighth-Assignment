\section{Report}

%Describe your learning/process so far on the survey paper.  I expect this to be short. 

During this week, Bill and I have been discussing the issues mentioned in the only peer review that we received. In the peer review, most of the issues mentioned have to do with missing acronyms definitions before we use them. 
Besides that we haven't done any changes in the paper, since it is an almost definitive version. Once we have Dr. Boult's review, we'll do all the changes that need to be made. 

As for the peer review that I had to do, I could only do one. The paper that I reviewed was a first draft. Therefore, it was somewhat challenging to do a proper review. I tried to highlight as many positive things as I could, but I feel like I ended up repeating the same positive aspects. The idea behind the paper was good, but it needed further developing. 

Inside my repo I have cloned the overleaf project. In this folder you can find all the files for the tex file.
